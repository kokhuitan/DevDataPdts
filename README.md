Your Shiny Application

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. 
The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
The application must include the following:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

In this project, my idea is to create an interactive website that allows 
an user to enter their weight and height. After they press submit (or enter), 
the website will return their Body Mass Index (BMI), as well as whether they 
have a healthy weight (or under or over weight).
